China confirms more cases of mystery viral pneumonia,https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/china-confirms-more-cases-mystery-viral-pneumonia-6176384.html,"China on Friday (Jan 3) confirmed more cases of a mystery viral pneumonia that has sparked fears about a resurgence of SARS, the flu-like virus that killed hundreds of people more than a decade ago.
The 44 cases, up from the initial 27 announced on Tuesday, include 11 ""severe cases"", health authorities in the central Chinese city of Wuhan said in a statement.
""The vital signs of the other patients are generally stable,"" the statement said.
The authorities are still in the process of identifying the cause of the infection, but ""influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus infection and other common respiratory diseases have been excluded"", the Wuhan health commission said on Friday, without mentioning SARS, which is caused by a coronavirus.
News of the mystery pneumonia outbreak earlier this week led to speculation online that it might be linked to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a highly contagious respiratory disease.
Wuhan police on Wednesday that said they had punished eight people for ""publishing or forwarding false information on the internet without verification"".
The health commission said all patients have received treatment in isolation and the city was tracking people who had come into close contact with the patients.
Some of those being treated work in a seafood market in the city, and ""no obvious evidence of human to human transmission"" has been found so far, the commission said.
Two women in Hong Kong were taken to public hospitals with fever and symptoms of respiratory infections or pneumonia symptoms, bringing the number of reported cases in the city since Dec 31 to five.
The two women, aged 12 and 41, had been to Wuhan in the past two weeks, the Hong Kong Hospital Authority said. They are being treated in isolation and are in a stable condition.
The city's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said epidemiological investigations revealed some of the patients in Wuhan were business operators at a local seafood market.
""A preliminary investigation shows that both patients had not been to a wet market in Wuhan before the onset of symptoms,"" the Hospital Authority's chief infection control officer Raymond Lai said.
Hong Kong's Hospital Authority has sent specimens to the Department of Health for testing.
The CHP has advised people to ""maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene"" in Hong Kong and while travelling.
""When travelling outside Hong Kong, the public should avoid visiting wet markets, live poulty markets or farms,"" it said in an advisory, adding that members of the public should also wear surgical masks and seek medical attention if they present symptoms.
It widened its scope of surveillance on Friday and urged doctors to make a report if they encounter patients with fever and acute respiratory or pneumonia symptoms, as well as those who have visited Wuhan 14 days prior to the onset of illness.
Port health measures were also stepped up. Additional thermal imaging systems were put in place at Hong Kong International Airport to check the body temperature of inbound travellers from Wuhan.
Additional manpower was also deployed at the West Kowloon train station to monitor inbound travellers.
""Those with relevant symptoms and travel history will be immediately referred to public hospitals for isolation, treatment and follow-up,"" the Department of Health said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) criticised China for under-reporting the number of SARS cases following the outbreak in 2003.
SARS killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong that year.
The virus, which infected more than 8,000 people around the world, is expected to have originated in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, according to WHO.
China sacked its then health minister Zhang Wenkang for the poor handling of the crisis in 2003, several months after the first case was reported.
WHO announced that China was free of SARS in May 2004.

I went to a new hospital and they admitted us. She has RSV bronchiolitis and corona virus. She’s getting help breathing with some pressure machine? She is breathing room oxygen on her own 100% but needs help because she’s still retracting.
I’ve been here 3 days already and it doesn’t seem to be getting better. They try to lower the machine from a 10 to an 8 and she does good for a while but then starts having trouble and has to go back to a 10.
Any tips? Anyone been through this??? She’s so little, I’m scared."

TOKYO (AP)  Japans government said Thursday a man treated for pneumonia after returning from China has tested positive for the new coronavirus identified as a possible cause of an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
The man developed a fever and cough on Jan. 3 while in Wuhan, returned to Japan on Jan. 6, and was hospitalized four days later as the symptoms persisted, with his X-ray image showing signs of pneumonia, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said.
Tests conducted Tuesday found the same coronavirus as had been detected in other patients in the Wuhan outbreak, the ministry said.
The man has since been released from hospital as his condition improved. He was only identified as a man in his 30s in the Kanagawa prefecture, west of Tokyo, and Kyodo News agency says he is Chinese. His family and medical staff who treated him have not been sickened.

Update and Interim Guidance on Outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China Distributed via the CDC Health Alert Network
January 17, 2020, 2030 ET (8:30 PM ET)
CDCHAN-00426
Summary
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to closely monitor an outbreak of a 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China that began in December 2019. CDC has established an Incident Management System to coordinate a domestic and international public health response.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people; numerous other coronaviruses circulate among animals, including camels, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people such as has been seen with Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) ( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html ) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ( https://www.cdc.gov/sars/index.html ).
Chinese authorities report most patients in the Wuhan City outbreak have been epidemiologically linked to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting a possible zoonotic origin to the outbreak. Chinese authorities additionally report that they are monitoring several hundred healthcare workers who are caring for outbreak patients; no spread of this virus from patients to healthcare personnel has been reported to date. Chinese authorities are reporting no ongoing spread of this virus in the community, but they cannot rule out that some limited person-to-person spread may be occurring. China has reported that two of the patients have died, including one with pre-existing medical conditions. Chinese health officials publicly posted the genetic sequence of the 2019-nCoV on January 12, 2020. This will facilitate identification of infections with this virus and development of specific diagnostic tests.
Thailand and Japan have confirmed additional cases of 2019-nCoV in travelers from Wuhan, China. It is possible that more cases will be identified in the coming days. This is an ongoing investigation and given previous experience with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, it is possible that person-person spread may occur. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with 2019-nCoV as the investigations in China, Thailand, and Japan continue. Additional information about this novel virus is needed to better inform population risk.
This HAN Update provides a situational update and guidance to state and local health departments and healthcare providers that supersedes guidance in CDC’s HAN Advisory 424 distributed on January 8, 2020. This HAN Update adds guidance for evaluation of patients under investigation (PUI) for 2019-nCoV, prevention and infection control guidance, including the addition of an eye protection recommendation, and additional information on specimen collection.
Background
An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City was initially reported to WHO on December 31, 2019. Chinese health authorities have confirmed more than 40 infections with a novel coronavirus as the cause of the outbreak. Reportedly, most patients had epidemiological links to a large seafood and animal market. The market was closed on January 1, 2020. Currently, Chinese health authorities report no community spread of this virus, and no transmission among healthcare personnel caring for outbreak patients. No additional cases of infection with 2019-nCoV have been identified in China since January 3, 2020.
On January 13, 2020 public health officials in Thailand confirmed detection of a human infection with 2019-nCoV in a traveler from Wuhan, China. This was the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV documented outside China. On January 17, 2020 a second case was confirmed in Thailand, also in a returned traveler from Wuhan City. On January 15, 2020 health officials in Japan confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in a returned traveler from Wuhan City. These persons had onset dates after January 3, 2020. These cases did not report visiting the large seafood and animal market to which many cases in China have been linked.
On January 11, 2020, CDC updated the level 1 travel health notice (“practice usual precautions”) for Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China with additional information (originally issued on January 6, 2020): https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/novel-coronavirus-china .
Recommendations for Healthcare Providers
Limited information is available to characterize the spectrum of clinical illness associated with 2019-nCoV. No vaccine or specific treatment for 2019-nCoV infection is available; care is supportive.
The CDC clinical criteria for a 2019-nCoV patient under investigation (PUI) have been developed based on what is known about MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and are subject to change as additional information becomes available.
Healthcare providers should obtain a detailed travel history for patients being evaluated with fever and acute respiratory illness. CDC guidance for evaluating and reporting a PUI for MERS-CoV remains unchanged.
Criteria to Guide Evaluation of Patients Under Investigation (PUI) for 2019-nCoV
Patients in the United States who meet the following criteria should be evaluated as a PUI in association with the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City, China.
1) Fever 1 AND symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath)
–and in the last 14 days before symptom onset,
History of travel from Wuhan City, China
-or- Close contact 2 with a person who is under investigation for 2019-nCOV while that person was ill. 2) Fever1 OR symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath)
–and in the last 14 days before symptom onset,
Close contact 2 with an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient. The above criteria are also available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/clinical-criteria.html . The criteria are intended to serve as guidance for evaluation. Patients should be evaluated and discussed with public health departments on a case-by-case basis if their clinical presentation or exposure history is equivocal (e.g., uncertain travel or exposure).
Recommendations for Reporting, Testing, and Specimen Collection
Healthcare providers should immediately notify both infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their local or state health department in the event of a PUI for 2019-nCoV. State health departments that have identified a PUI should immediately contact CDC’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 and complete a 2019-nCoV PUI case investigation form available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf pdf icon . CDC’s EOC will assist local/state health departments to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately to CDC, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays. At this time, diagnostic testing for 2019-nCoV can be conducted only at CDC. Testing for other respiratory pathogens should not delay specimen shipping to CDC. If a PUI tests positive for another respiratory pathogen, after clinical evaluation and consultation with public health authorities, they may no longer be considered a PUI. This may evolve as more information becomes available on possible 2019 nCoV co-infections.
For biosafety reasons, it is not recommended to perform virus isolation in cell culture or initial characterization of viral agents recovered in cultures of specimens from a PUI for 2019-nCoV. To increase the likelihood of detecting 2019-nCoV infection, CDC recommends collecting and testing multiple clinical specimens from different sites, including all three specimen types—lower respiratory, upper respiratory, and serum specimens. Additional specimen types (e.g., stool, urine) may be collected and stored. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified regardless of time of symptom onset. Additional guidance for collection, handling, and testing of clinical specimens is available at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/ .
Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients Under Investigation for 2019-nCoV
Although the transmission dynamics have yet to be determined, CDC currently recommends a cautious approach to patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV ( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/clinical-criteria.html ). Such patients should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be evaluated in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne infection isolation room if available. Healthcare personnel entering the room should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield). Immediately notify your healthcare facility’s infection control personnel and local health department.

US to screen passengers for China mystery virus,https://defence.pk/pdf/threads/us-to-screen-passengers-for-china-mystery-virus.650132/,"US authorities will begin screening passengers Friday arriving on direct or connecting flights from a Chinese city at the heart of a mysterious SARS-like virus responsible for two deaths. Travelers from Wuhan to the United States will undergo entry screening for symptoms associated with the new coronavirus at three airports: San Francisco, New York's JFK and Los Angeles. China has now reported 45 cases linked to the virus, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official Nancy Messonnier told reporters in a press call, most linked to a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, while two cases have been found in Thailand and one in Japan. The CDC said that based on current information, the risk to Americans from the virus, known by its technical name 2019-nCoV, is currently deemed low. Nevertheless it was enhancing precautionary measures. The CDC will deploy 100 additional staff to the three airports, with incoming passengers asked to fill out a questionnaire and submit to a temperature check. Those who show possible signs will be shifted to another facility for additional screening and a rapid diagnostic test. Messonnier said that this test would currently take around a day, ""but it's going to get rapidly faster"" as the diagnostic tool improves. The UN's health agency says that the outbreak of the disease comes from a never-before-seen strain belonging to a broad family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses such as SARS. According to Arnaud Fontanet, head of Paris' Institut Pasteur department of epidemiology, the new strain is the seventh known type of coronavirus that humans can contract. The outbreak has caused alarm because of the link with SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Fontanet added that the coronavirus appears to be ""weaker"" than SARS in its current form, but cautioned that it could mutate into a more virulent strain. © 2020 AFP"

A 35-year-old Chinese woman who flew in from Wuhan, the apparent epicentre of the outbreak, was confirmed to have the new coronavirus strain, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. ""She was visiting Seoul on a tour for the Lunar New Year holidays,"" said KCDC director Jung Eun-kyeong, adding Korean authorities were investigating her movement on the plane and those who might have come in contact with her, including flight attendants.

China Confirms Human-to-human Transmission As WHO Emergency Group Meets,https://www.ibtimes.com/china-confirms-human-human-transmission-who-emergency-group-meets-2905461,"A SARS-like virus that has spread across China and reached three other Asian nations is contagious between humans, a government expert said Monday, and the World Health Organization announced that a key emergency committee would meet this week to discuss the infections.
The new coronavirus strain, first discovered in the central city of Wuhan, has caused alarm because of its connection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.
The total number of people diagnosed with the new virus has risen to 218.
No human-to-human transmission has been confirmed so far, but Wuhan's health commission has previously said the possibility 'cannot be excluded' Photo: AFP / STR Beijing and Shanghai confirmed their first cases on Monday while more than a dozen more emerged in southern Guangdong province and 136 new ones were found over the weekend in Wuhan, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
A third person died in Wuhan, the local health commission said.
Scientists have scrambled to determine the mode of transmission, with a seafood market in Wuhan believed to be the centre of the outbreak.
A seafood market is believed to be the centre of the outbreak in the city, but health officials have reported that some patients had no history of contact with the facility Photo: AFP / NOEL CELIS But Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at the National Health Commission who helped expose the scale of the SARS outbreak, said patients could contract the new virus without having visited the city.
""Currently, it can be said it is affirmative that there is the phenomenon of human-to-human transmission,"" he said in an interview with CCTV.
In Guangdong, two patients were infected by family members who visited Wuhan, Zhong explained.

Photo: AFP / Gal ROMA Fourteen medical personnel helping with coronavirus patients have also been infected, he said, though he added that more than 95 of the total cases were related to Wuhan.
Zhong predicted an increase of viral pneumonia cases during the Lunar New Year holiday -- when millions travel in China -- but expressed confidence in curbing the spread of the virus, China's official Xinhua news agency reported.
The World Health Organization panel will meet in Geneva on Wednesday to determine whether to declare the outbreak ""a public health emergency of international concern"" -- a rare designation only used for the gravest epidemics.
A mysterious SARS-like virus has spread around China -- including to Beijing -- authorities said Monday, fuelling fears of a major outbreak as millions begin travelling for the Lunar New Year in humanity's biggest migration. Photo: AFPTV / Leo RAMIREZ WHO said earlier that an animal source seemed to be ""the most likely primary source"" with ""some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts.""
Wuhan has 11 million inhabitants and serves as a major transport hub, including during the annual Lunar New Year holiday, which begins later this week and sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel across the country to visit family.
Weighing in on the matter for the first time, President Xi Jinping said Monday that safeguarding people's lives should be given ""top priority"" and that the spread of the epidemic ""should be resolutely contained,"" according to CCTV.
During the annual Lunar New Year holiday hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel across the country to visit family Photo: AFP / NOEL CELIS Xi said it was necessary to ""release information on the epidemic in a timely manner and deepen international cooperation,"" and ensure people have a ""stable and peaceful Spring Festival,"" the broadcaster said.
Five cases were reported in Beijing, while in Shanghai a 56-year-old woman who had come from Wuhan was hospitalised and in stable condition, local health authorities said.
South Korea on Monday also reported its first case -- a 35-year-old woman who flew in from Wuhan. Thailand and Japan have previously confirmed a total of three cases -- all of whom had visited the Chinese city.
There are also six suspected cases in Shanghai and in four provinces and regions in the east, south and southwest of the country.
The virus did not slow down the annual holiday travel rush, though some travellers wore masks at crowded railway stations in Beijing and Shanghai.
,
The WHO said the new cases in China were the result of ""increased searching and testing for (the virus) among people sick with respiratory illness.""
Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London warned in a paper published Friday that the number of cases in Wuhan was likely to be closer to 1,700, much higher than the official figure.
Wuhan authorities said they have installed infrared thermometers at airports and railway and coach stations across the city. Passengers with fever were being registered, given masks and taken to medical institutions.
State TV footage showed medical staff working inside an isolation ward at a Wuhan hospital in hazmat suits.
In Hong Kong, health officials said they were expanding enhanced checks on arrivals to include anyone coming in from Hubei province, not just its capital Wuhan. More than 100 people are being monitored in the city.
In Wuhan, 170 people are still being treated at hospital, including nine in critical condition, the city's health commission said.

“The virus’ ability to spread and adapt to the population, as well as its onset and pathogenicity, is similar to the way Sars developed in the early stage,” Guan said in the Caixin report. “I hope we can learn from the lessons of Sars and hope we don’t approach prevention and control of the [current] situation in a similar way as Sars, otherwise it will negatively affect people and the world.”"

"Asia Steps Up Checks As China Virus Kills Six, Infects More Than 300",https://www.ibtimes.com/asia-steps-checks-china-virus-kills-six-infects-more-300-2906266,"Asian countries on Tuesday ramped up measures to block the spread of a new virus as the death toll in China rose to six and the number of cases surpassed 300, raising concerns in the middle of a major holiday travel rush.
Nations across the Asia-Pacific region stepped up checks of passengers at airports to detect the SARS-like coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
Fears of a bigger outbreak rose after a prominent expert from China's National Health Commission confirmed late Monday that the virus can be passed between people.
Regional map including China, Japan, Thailand, South Korea, and Wuhan Seafood Market, identified as the centre of a pneumonia outbreak that has sickened dozens and killed four. Photo: AFP / Gal ROMA Authorities previously said there was no obvious evidence of person-to-person transmission and animals were suspected to be the source, as a seafood market where live animals were sold in Wuhan was identified as the centre of the outbreak.
But the World Health Organization (WHO), which was concluding a fact-finding mission in Wuhan, was still being cautious, saying at a briefing in Geneva that ""not enough is known to draw definitive conclusions about how it is transmitted"".
Spokesman Tarik Jasarevic warned though that ""more cases should be expected"" both in China and in other countries.
The discovery of human-to-human transmission comes as hundreds of millions of people are criss-crossing the country in packed trains, buses and planes this week to celebrate the Lunar New Year Photo: AFP / WANG Zhao Hundreds of millions of people are criss-crossing China this week in packed buses, trains and planes to celebrate the Lunar New Year with relatives.
More than 80 new cases have been confirmed, bringing the total number of people hit by the virus in China to 315, with the vast majority in Hubei, the province where Wuhan lies, according to the National Health Commission (NHC), as well as reports from regional health commissions.
Other cases have also been confirmed in cities around the country, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing.
Japan is among the two other countries -- apart from Thailand -- that have so far reported cases of the new virus Photo: JIJI PRESS / STR Regional governments have started to confirm cases as well, including Guangdong, Zhejiang and Henan provinces.
Meanwhile Wang Guangfa, one of the doctors on the NHC team investigating the epidemic, told Hong Kong TV station iCable News that he was receiving treatment after becoming infected.
The first case on the self-ruled island of Taiwan was also confirmed Tuesday, with a woman taken to hospital on arrival at the airport from Wuhan.
Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV Tuesday that the death toll had risen from four to six.

Photo: AFP / Simon MALFATTO China said it would attend a special WHO meeting Wednesday which will determine whether to declare a rare global public health emergency over the disease, which was also detected in Thailand, Japan and South Korea among four people who had visited Wuhan.
The coronavirus has caused alarm because of its genetic similarities to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.
A seafood market in Wuhan has been identified as the centre of the outbreak Photo: AFP / NOEL CELIS At four airports in Thailand, authorities introduced mandatory thermal scans of passengers arriving from high-risk areas of China. Anyone exhibiting signs of fever will be quarantined for 24 hours for monitoring.
Around 1,300 passengers are expected each day in Thailand from Wuhan over Chinese New Year, which starts on Friday.
In Hong Kong, where memories of SARS still haunt the city, authorities said they were on ""extreme high alert"", with passengers from Wuhan required to fill out health declarations and face possible jail time if they do not declare symptoms.
Enhanced screening measures have also been set up at airports in Australia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Singapore and the United States. Malaysia and Vietnam have also installed thermal scanners at airports.
A man showing symptoms of the disease who had travelled to Wuhan has been put in isolation in Australia as health officials await test results, authorities said Tuesday.
In China, the government announced it was classifying the outbreak in the same category as SARS, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the disease and the potential to implement quarantine measures on travel.
In Wuhan, authorities banned tour groups and police were conducting spot checks for live poultry or wild animals in vehicles leaving and entering the city, state media said.
It added that city health authorities had scheduled 800 beds to be made available in three hospitals and 1,200 more would soon be ready.
Passengers were being screened for fever at the airport, railway stations and bus terminals. Those with fevers would be registered, handed masks and advised to see a doctor.
Chinese train and plane authorities said travellers with tickets to Wuhan could get refunds.
Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at the National Health Commission, raised the alarm when he said on Monday that patients can contract the virus without having visited Wuhan, though he added that it was milder than SARS.
Doctors at the University of Hong Kong released a study on Tuesday estimating that there have been 1,343 cases of the new virus in Wuhan. Scientists at Imperial College in London said last week the number was likely closer to 1,700.
China was accused of covering up the SARS outbreak in 2003 but some foreign experts have praised the swift release of information on this new virus.

Bank of Japan kept interest rates unchanged, while raising 2020 growth forecasts. Asian markets plunged overnight U.S. stocks traded lower on Tuesday, after the long weekend, as China warned of the outbreak of a contagious new virus.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 23.74 points to 29,324.36 while the S&P 500 slipped 2.09 points to 3,327.53 and the Nasdaq Composite Index edged down 0.9 of a point to 9,388.05.
The outbreak of a new contagious coronavirus in China that has killed at least six people recalled fears from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, crisis from 2003. The new virus has infected at least 300 people. Asian stock markets dropped overnight.
“For the market, the more meaningful driver still remains the economic cycle and earnings momentum,” said Fan Cheuk Wan , Asia chief market strategist at HSBC Private Bank. “Based on previous experience we have come across during SARS, the impact of the virus is likely to be short-lived.”
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that a phase two trade deal between China and the U.S. might not eliminate all existing tariffs. “We may do 2A and some of the tariffs come off. We can do this sequentially along the way,” he said.
At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, President Donald Trump hailed the U.S. economy.
“America’s newfound prosperity is undeniable, unprecedented and unmatched anywhere in the world,” Trump said. “America achieved this stunning turnaround not by making minor changes to a handful of policies, but by adopting a whole new approach centered entirely on the well-being of the American worker. Every decision we make on taxes, trade, regulation, energy, immigration, education and more is focused on improving the lives of everyday Americans. Only when governments put their own citizens first will people be fully invested in their national futures.”
The Bank of Japan kept its key i nterest rate u nchanged at minus-0.1% and also upgraded its growth forecast for fiscal 2020 to 0.9% from 0.7%.
U.K. employment grew by 208,000 for the three months to November as the unemployment rate remained at 3.8%, the Office for National Statistics reported Tuesday.
White House top economic advisor Larry Kudlow said U.S. economic growth will exceed 3% in 2020.
“This is a long cycle and what you’ve got here in the Trump years is essentially a mini upcycle,” Kudlow said. “You’ve gone from 1.5% to 2% growth. We had it going at almost 4% then the Fed tightened.”
John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, thinks the U.S. stock market can keep moving higher.
“We think stocks could run for a while, absent some event,” he said. “We’re starting to see signs of confirmation elsewhere. It’s not just the Nasdaq and the big tech names.”
But hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones is skeptical about the recent rally.
“We are just again in this craziest monetary and fiscal mix in history. It’s so explosive. It defies imagination,” Jones, founder of Tudor Investments, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Overnight in Asia, markets finished broadly lower. China’s Shanghai Composite dropped 1.41%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng plunged 2.81%, and Japan’s Nikkei-225 fell 0.91%.
In Europe markets finished mixed, as Britain’s FTSE-100 dropped 0.53%, France’s CAC-40 fell 0.54% and Germany’s DAX gained 0.05%.

First U.S. case of potentially deadly Chinese coronavirus confirmed in Washington state,http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message4243485/pg1,"First U.S. case of potentially deadly Chinese coronavirus confirmed in Washington state First U.S. case of potentially deadly Chinese coronavirus confirmed in Washington stateA man in Washington state has been diagnosed with the mysterious virus spreading through Asia, the first case confirmed in the United States of an illness that began in China last month and has killed at least six people and sickened hundreds more, according to people familiar with the investigation.The man is in stable condition. He arrived in the United States last week, before federal health officials began screening travelers from the central Chinese city of Wuhan at Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York’s John F. Kennedy international airports, the first such screening since the 2014 Ebola outbreak.Neither the man’s identity, nor his travel route have been released.The outbreak has grown rapidly in recent days, with authorities in China reporting confirmed cases in multiple cities as hundreds of millions of people in China and elsewhere in Asia are on the move in the run-up to the Lunar New Year, the biggest migration event in the world. The infection is believed to have begun among people who shopped or worked at an animal market in Wuhan. But its rapid spread led officials to conclude that people, as well as animals, can transmit the infection.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold to much more serious diseases, which can infect both humans and animals, according to WHO. The strain spreading in China is related to two other coronaviruses that have caused major outbreaks in recent years: Middle East respiratory syndrome, also known as MERS, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.“Since this is a respiratory virus, it is spread easier than Ebola so it brings with it more fear of easily being transmitted between people,” said Matthew Frieman, a virologist and associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who studies coronaviruses. “I don’t know how people would react about this virus showing up here.”The World Health Organization is meeting Wednesday to decide whether to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency.Symptoms of a coronavirus infection include respiratory problems, difficulties breathing, fever and cough, and can lead to severe cases of pneumonia, kidney failure, acute respiratory syndrome (when fluid builds up in the lungs) and death. The elderly, young and those with an already weakened immune system are at a higher risk of developing severe lower-respiratory tract diseases, like bronchitis and pneumonia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But the optimism has given way to fears about an outbreak of a virus that resembles SARS, a disease that killed hundreds in China and Hong Kong and hammered the local equities market.
The new coronavirus strain, which has spread from the mainland city of Wuhan, has infected more than 200 people. On Tuesday authorities said a fourth person had died from it.
A top scientist at China's National Health Commission said the strain has now been found to pass between humans, a major worry days before the Lunar New Year holiday, which sees hundreds of millions of people travel across the country.
""The timing is unfortunate as the great migration that is Chinese New Year starts in mainland China,"" said OANDA's Jeffrey Halley. ""The accompanying possibility is that infectious cases could rise. Asia will remember back to the origins of SARS outbreak and its adverse effects on economic activity in the region.""
And Stephen Innes, an analyst at AxiCorp, warned that ""the cost to the global economy can be quite staggering in negative GDP terms if this outbreak reaches epidemic proportions, as until this week the market was underestimating the potential of the flu spreading"".
He added: ""If things turn critical, it could provide a massive blow to the airline industry and a knockout punch to local tourism.""
Shares in airlines including Cathay Pacific tumbled in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng Index hit by worries about the SARS-like virus in China and Moody's downgrade of the city's credit rating Photo: AFP / Anthony WALLACE Airlines were among the worst hit stocks. Cathay plunged more than four percent and Air China tumbled nearly six percent.
Casino operators, who rely on tourism, were also sharply lower. Wynn Macau shed 4.8 percent and Galaxy Entertainment was off 3.6 percent.
The Hang Seng Index sank 2.8 percent and was taking a hit across the board after Moody's said it had lowered its credit rating in a fresh blow to the financial hub, which likely fell into recession last year owing to months of demonstrations as well as the China-US trade war.
In a statement, the firm said: ""The absence of tangible plans to address either the political or economic and social concerns of the Hong Kong population that have come to the fore in the past nine months may reflect weaker inherent institutional capacity than Moody's had previously assessed.""
The move comes as the business community grows increasingly worried that the features that give Hong Kong more political and economic autonomy are weakening under pressure from Beijing.
The decision by Moody's came four months after a similar move by Fitch, which cited the demonstrations and uncertainty caused by closer integration with the Chinese mainland.
Among other firms to have been beaten down Tuesday, market heavyweight Tencent sank 2.7 percent, while property developers were well off with Henderson Land diving three percent and Swire properties 3.3 percent off.

Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),https://www.businesstraveller.com/forums/topic/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/,"Chinese authorities have identified a cluster of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan City, China.
The patients showed symptoms such as fever, dyspnoea, and were diagnosed as viral pneumonia.
China’s National Health Commission on Monday, Jan 20, confirmed for the first time that the infection could be transmitted from human-to-human.

China Says Virus Spreading Between Humans As WHO Set To Meet,https://www.ibtimes.com/china-says-virus-spreading-between-humans-who-set-meet-2906266,"China has confirmed human-to-human transmission in the outbreak of a new SARS-like virus as the number of cases soared and authorities Tuesday said a fourth person had died.
The news came as the World Health Organization said it would consider declaring an international public health emergency over the outbreak.
Regional map including China, Japan, Thailand, South Korea, and Wuhan Seafood Market, identified as the centre of a pneumonia outbreak that has sickened dozens and killed four. Photo: AFP / Gal ROMA The coronavirus, which has spread to three other Asian countries and infected more than 200 people in China, has caused alarm because of its genetic similarities to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.
The discovery of human-to-human transmission comes as hundreds of millions of people are criss-crossing the country in packed trains, buses and planes this week to celebrate the Lunar New Year with relatives.
Health authorities in the central city of Wuhan, where a seafood market has been identified as the centre of the outbreak, said Tuesday that an 89-year-old man became the fourth person to die from the virus and that 15 medical staff had been infected.

The virus has also reached Japan, Thailand and South Korea, with a total of four people having been hospitalised after visiting Wuhan.
A man showing symptoms of the new disease who travelled to the Chinese city has been put in isolation in Australia as health officials await test results, public broadcaster ABC reported Tuesday.
Japan is among the two other countries -- apart from Thailand -- that have so far reported cases of the new virus Photo: JIJI PRESS / STR Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at China's national health commission, confirmed that the virus was being transmitted between humans, state media reported late Monday.

Photo: AFP / Simon MALFATTO The WHO had previously identified animals as the likely primary source, but had warned of ""some limited human-to-human transmission"".
Zhong told CCTV that patients can contract the virus without having visited Wuhan.
He also said 14 medical staff had been infected but it was not clear if he was referring to the Wuhan cases.
A seafood market in Wuhan has been identified as the centre of the outbreak Photo: AFP / NOEL CELIS In southern Guangdong province, two patients were infected by family members who visited Wuhan, he told CCTV.
The WHO said a key emergency committee would meet Wednesday to determine whether to declare an international public health emergency.
The agency has only used the rare label a handful of times, including during the H1N1 -- or swine flu -- pandemic of 2009 and the Ebola epidemic that devastated parts of West Africa from 2014 to 2016.
The Chinese government announced Tuesday it was classifying the outbreak in the same category as the SARS outbreak, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the disease and the potential to implement quarantine measures on travel.
China's President Xi Jinping said that the virus must be ""resolutely contained"" and stressed that information must be released ""in a timely manner"", in his first public comments on the outbreak on Monday.
The Communist government was accused of covering up the SARS outbreak in 2003 but some foreign experts have praised the swift release of information on the new virus.
""The speed of response is testimony to improved global preparedness,"" said Jeremy Farrar, director of British healthcare foundation Wellcome Trust.
""But we must not be complacent, there is still much to be done to ensure countries across the world are protecting people from epidemic threats of diseases known and unknown,"" he said.
Nearly 200 confirmed cases are in Wuhan, where the city announced it was enforcing stronger supervision of markets and public transportation hubs, and ""encouraged the cancellation"" of unnecessary public gatherings.
The city has set up an epidemic prevention and control headquarters.
Special screening measures have been set up at airports in Australia, Singapore, the United States, and Thailand.
In Hong Kong, health officials said they were expanding enhanced checks on arrivals to include anyone coming in from Hubei province, not just its capital Wuhan.
Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London warned in a paper published Friday that the number of cases in Wuhan was likely to be closer to 1,700, much higher than the official figure.

It could be spread by sharing the same toilet.
there was a study I read a few years later about possible transmission in one hotel in China through aerosols from a toilet plume. They never proved that was the mode by which the other neighbors caught it, but it's intriguing.
I suppose there's no word yet on how people not in the markets are getting this new coronavirus? I guess SARS is the working model for now. There was an issue with sewage drainage at one apartment building so that would include toilets. That might be what you are thinking of. Hong Kong seals apartment building to contain SARS Quote: : WHO officials said they still believe the disease spreads mainly by close contact, but reported that epidemiologists were considering the possibility that systems in the building somehow spread infectious bodily secretions. There were also the nine international travelers that had been in the same elevator that all got infected on their way out of the country.
It turned out there were super-spreaders: Quote: : Gerberding also said some SARS patients seem to be ""extremely efficient transmitters"" of the disease. In Hanoi, for example, one patient transmitted the illness to 56% of the healthcare workers who came in contact with him or her, she said. One reason we were able to contain the SARS pandemic is there were few or no asymptomatic cases. If you can identify all cases you can isolate them and their contacts. As an example:
Quote: : WHO officials said in statement. ""Because of his early identification of the disease, global surveillance was heightened and many new cases have been identified and isolated before they infected hospital staff. In Hanoi, SARS appears to be coming under control.""
The current new virus is spreading person to person so that's likely to be respiratory secretions."

Unfortunately I am not sure exactly what you mean . Assuming that English is not your first language what I THINK you are trying to say is that you decided to cancel a booking made through Explore because of the 2019-nCoV (Wuhan coronavirus) outbreak and are having difficulty with Explore getting any money back and/or are unhappy at the cancellation fees they charge - is that correct ?
Even if the ticket you bought is a fully refundable one, the contract you entered into with Explore when booking your trip via them commits you to paying the fees outlined in the company's published T&Cs . All the fees that the company charges for handling cancellation requests, changes to bookings etc . etc are shown in those T&Cs and by proceeding through the booking process you have AGREED to pay them so they are legally entitled to deduct them from any refund you may be due from the airline
If the tickets were non refundable ones (as many sold by this type of cheap deal OTA usually are) and the flight itself was not cancelled by the airline , then you are probably not entitled to full refund anyway (on non refundable tickets you only get any airport taxes back) and Explore are still entitled to charge their cancellation fees from that and only give you any small balance left.
Your best option may be to see whether your travel insurance covers you for cancelling the trip, but I fear that deciding not to go because of worries about the Wuhan virus probably isn't covered because unless your government advice to its citizens is not to travel ( the British FCO -Foreign and Commonwealth Office- has not issued any advice to British nationals that it’s not safe to travel at this stage - (the latest advice on the Public Health England website as of today is merely that ""The risk to visitors to Wuhan is moderate reflecting an increase in the number of cases being identified in China and evidence that the virus has limited spread from person to person"")

The nightmare is all too real. A man arrives at a health centre, complaining of a sore throat, fever and headache. Another person arrives soon after; then another. By lunchtime, there are dozens; within a week, hundreds.
The winter months usually see an onset of influenza. But this time far more people than normal are infected.
That is not the only strange thing. Usually, the flu virus flourishes among the young and the old, with less robust immune systems. But those turning up to see the doctor are primarily in the prime of life, aged 20 to 40, who usually have no problem seeing off what is usually a seasonal bug.
Soon it becomes clear that something is very wrong. It turns out that those who are sick are not coming just to one hospital in a single town; they are turning up everywhere. Literally everywhere. All over the world. A quarter of the world’s population report symptoms. And then people start dying. In large numbers.
The scale is frightening. In the U.S., where a third of the population are infected, hundreds of thousands die. India pays a terrible price as 18 million succumb.
This is no Hollywood blockbuster, hoping to scare its way to box office success. This is what happened 100 years ago as the Spanish flu took hold. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7909471/As-Chinese-coronavirus-claims-victims-PETER-FRANKOPAN-examines-lesson-past.html
Even more, interesting is many of the deaths are now believed to be down to the then newly popular aspirin. Aspirin was given in huge amounts especially to military personal and the symptoms of flu and aspirin overdose are very alike.
OK, I didn't know that. Interesting."
